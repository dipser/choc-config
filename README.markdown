# drudgeâ€™s tasty Chocolat config

This is my personal configuration for the [Chocolat](http://chocolatapp.com) text editor. The focus on this configuration is on developing web applications in JavaScript (namely, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)).

This is also the testbed for my Chocolat development. There are unstable and/or unreleased mixins, syntaxes, etc. You've been warned.

## Features

  * Experimental Taskpaper syntax and keyboard completion mixin
  * Puppet configuration file syntax
  * Github Flavored Markdown Preview
  * JavaScript tools (convert lines to array, lines to string, eval to editor, etc.)
  * Gist & Pastie support
  * Generate cross-browser CSS from CSS3 properties with Prefixr
  * Upload files with Transmit 4
  * Strip trailing whitespace & remove non-ASCII characters commands
  * Useful snippets for Node.js development. *See: [node.truffle](https://github.com/drudge/node.truffle)*
  * Supports completions for Node.js API
  * Adds templates for easily creating Node.js modules or Locomotive controllers

## Installation

### One-liner

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/drudge/choc-config/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

It will abort if you have an existing `Chocolat` folder in `~/Library/Application Support`. Either move it out of the way, or download and run the bootstrap.sh script interactively to be prompted to overwrite.

**Note:** The bootstrap script does change some Chocolat preferences, so check the source of the file prior to running to make sure you're cool with that.

### Using Git

To just install my Syntaxes and Mixins, simply clone the repository and the submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drudge/choc-config.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Chocolat --recursive
```

If you are interested in adding my compeltions and/or templates, you'll need to run the following commands in your terminal:

**Node.js Completions**

```bash
CHOCOLAT_APP=/Applications/Chocolat.app/
rm $CHOCOLAT_APP/Contents/Resources/completions.json
ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Chocolat/completions.json $CHOCOLAT_APP/Contents/Resources/completions.json
```

**Node.js Templates**

```bash
CHOCOLAT_APP=/Applications/Chocolat.app/
rm $CHOCOLAT_APP/Contents/Resources/boilerplate.json
ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Chocolat/boilerplate.json $CHOCOLAT_APP/Contents/Resources/boilerplate.json
```
